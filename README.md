## Objective
* Our client is a large Swiss pension fund who has a substantial allocation to Swiss equities. He is a firm believer of risk premia and is fully convinced by the long-term benefits of tilting his portfolio to reap the benefits of well-known risk premia.
* With no particular view on which risk premia is best suited for him, he wants to go for a diversified approach. He is nevertheless concerned by the time-varying nature of factor returns and fears of being unable to cope with a too long period of underperformance of one given factor.
* He is therefore thinking about the potentials of adjusting his exposure to the various risk premia over time and make his portfolio more dynamic.
* He is willing to give a mandate for managing a dynamic long-only portfolio of risk premia on the Swiss market. Tracking error is also a concern for him.

## Data
* Monthly/daily returns on equities for the Swiss market (SPI). Any other data necessary
to build the risk premia portfolio (na√Øve strategies) and to time the styles.
